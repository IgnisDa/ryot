Ryot (**R**oll **Y**our **O**wn **T**racker), pronounced "riot", aims to be the
only self hosted tracker you will ever need!

## üìù ELI5

Imagine you have a special notebook where you can write down all the media you
have consumed, like books you've read, shows you have watched, video games you
have played or workouts you have done. Now, imagine that instead of a physical
notebook, you have a special tool on your computer or phone that lets you keep
track of all these digitally.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ [Supports](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot/discussions/4) tracking media and fitness.
- ‚úÖ Import data
  - Goodreads
  - MediaTracker
- ‚úÖ Self-hosted
- ‚úÖ Documented GraphQL API
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand UI
- ‚úÖ Lightning fast (written in Rust BTW)
- ‚úÖ Free and open-source

## üß™ Project Status

This project is still very much a WIP. Until it hits `1.0.0`, consider the project
to have breaking changes without any warning, for example backwards incompatible
schema changes. You can see the latest release
[here](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot/releases).

## üìñ Guides

Some things might not be obvious on how to setup or get working. I have written
a number of guides to make thing easier.

- [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment.md): Deploy Ryot to various platforms
- [Importing](/docs/guides/importing.md): Import data from various sources
- [Video Games](/docs/guides/video-games.md): Get video games tracking working

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to use?

**NOTE**: The first user you register is automatically set as admin of the instance.

### üê≥ Option 1: Use Docker

To get a demo server running, use the docker image:

```bash
$ docker run --detach \
  --publish 8000:8000 \
  --volume ./ryot-data:/data \
  --volume ./config/ryot.example.json:/data/config/ryot.json \
  --name ryot \
  ghcr.io/ignisda/ryot:latest
```

### üßë‚ÄçüíªOption 2: Compile and run from source

- Install [moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/)

```bash
# Build the frontend
$ moon run frontend:build

# Run it
$ cargo run --bin ryot --release
```

## üîß Configuration options

You can specify configuration options via files (loaded from `config/ryot.json`,
`config/ryot.toml`, `config/ryot.yaml`). You can see a minimal example in
[`config/ryot.example.json`](/config/ryot.example.json). Ryot writes the
configuration loaded at runtime to `computed-config.ron` for debugging purposes.

Only the `DATABASE_URL` variable is loaded from the environment.

**Note**: You can see the defaults in the [config](/apps/backend/src/config.rs)
builder.

## ü§ì Developer notes

In production, the frontend is a pre-rendered Nextjs app served statically by the
Axum backend server.

In development, both servers are started independently running on `:3000` and
`:8000` respectively. To get them running, install [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs),
and run `mprocs` in the project root. If you do not want to install `mprocs`,
take a look at [`mproc.yaml`](/mprocs.yaml) to see what all commands are
needed to get it working.
