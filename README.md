<h2 align="center">
  A self hosted platform for tracking various facets of your life - media,
  fitness etc.
</h2>

Ryot (**R**oll **Y**our **O**wn **T**racker), pronounced "riot", aims to be the
only self hosted tracker you will ever need!

## üíª Demo

You can use the demo instance hosted on [Fly.io](https://ryot.fly.dev). Login
and register with the username `demo` and password `demo-password`. This instance
is automatically deployed from the latest release.

**NOTE**: The data in this instance can be deleted randomly.

## üìù ELI5

Imagine you have a special notebook where you can write down all the media you
have consumed, like books you've read, shows you have watched, video games you
have played or workouts you have done. Now, imagine that instead of a physical
notebook, you have a special tool on your computer or phone that lets you keep
track of all these digitally.

## üí° Why?

- Existing solutions do not have very good UI.
- Pretty graphs and summaries make everyone happy. Ryot aims to have a lot of them.
- There is a lack of a good selfhosted fitness and health tracking solution.
- Ryot consumes very little memory (around 8MB idle eyeballing `docker stats`),
  something that is significantly useful in RAM constrained environments.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ [Supports](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot/discussions/4) tracking media
  and fitness.
- ‚úÖ Import data
  - Goodreads
  - MediaTracker
- ‚úÖ Self-hosted
- ‚úÖ Documented GraphQL API
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand UI
- ‚úÖ Lightning fast (written in Rust BTW)
- ‚úÖ Free and open-source

## üß™ Project Status

This project is in beta and getting some finishing touches. I do not expect it
to have any more breaking changes. But for the sake of clarity, all releases are
being marked as pre-releases. You can see the releases
[here](https://github.com/IgnisDa/ryot/releases).

## üìñ Guides

Some things might not be obvious on how to setup or get working. I have written
a number of guides to make thing easier.

- [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment.md): Deploy Ryot to various platforms
- [Importing](/docs/guides/importing.md): Import data from various sources
- [Video Games](/docs/guides/video-games.md): Get video games tracking working

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to use?

**NOTE**: The first user you register is automatically set as admin of the instance.

### üê≥ Option 1: Use Docker

To get a demo server running, use the docker image:

```bash
$ docker run --pull always \
  --detach \
  --publish 8000:8000 \
  --volume ./ryot-data:/data \
  --volume ./config/ryot.example.json:/data/config/ryot.json \
  --name ryot \
  ghcr.io/ignisda/ryot:latest
```

### üì¶ Option 2: Quick-run a release

Each release has an installation script that can be used to install the `ryot`
binary. Follow the instructions in the release to use this script. 

**Alternatively** using [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget):
```bash
$ eget ignisda/ryot
```

### üßë‚ÄçüíªOption 3: Compile and run from source

- Install [moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/)

```bash
# Build the frontend
$ moon run frontend:build

# Run it
$ cargo run --bin ryot --release
```

## üîß Configuration options

You can specify configuration options via files (loaded from `config/ryot.json`,
`config/ryot.toml`, `config/ryot.yaml`) or via environment variables.

Environment variables are split by the `__` delimiter. For example, the key
`audio_books.audible.url` corresponds to the variable `AUDIO_BOOKS__AUDIBLE__URL`.
The only exception to the `__` delimiter rule is the `DATABASE_URL` environment
variable which will be loaded directly.

Ryot writes the final configuration loaded at runtime to `computed-config.ron`
for debugging purposes.

**Note**: You can see the defaults in the [config](/apps/backend/src/config.rs)
builder. A minimal example configuration is in [`ryot.example.json`](/config/ryot.example.json).

## ü§ì Developer notes

In production, the frontend is a pre-rendered Nextjs app served statically by the
Axum backend server.

In development, both servers are started independently running on `:3000` and
`:8000` respectively. To get them running, install [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs),
and run `mprocs` in the project root. If you do not want to install `mprocs`,
take a look at [`mproc.yaml`](/mprocs.yaml) to see what all commands are
needed to get it working.
