Ryot (**R**oll **Y**our **O**wn **T**racker), pronounced "riot", aims to be the only self
hosted tracker you will ever need!

## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR `v9.*` USERS

If you were using `v9.*` of Ryot, please read the
[guide](https://docs.ryot.io/migration.html#from-v9-to-v10) for migration instructions to
`v10`.

## Pro version

Ryot is available in two versions - community and pro. The pro version has additional
features like profile sharing, recommendations, supercharged collections etc. [Learn
more](https://ryot.io) about the pro version.

## 💻 Demo

You can use the demo account on the pro instance using [this
link](https://demo.ryot.io/_s/acl_vUMPnPirkHlT).

**NOTE**: The data in this demo account is reset every 24 hours.

## 📝 ELI5

Imagine you have a special notebook where you can write down all the media you have
consumed, like books you've read, shows you have watched, video games you have played or
workouts you have done. Now, imagine that instead of a physical notebook, you have a
special tool on your computer or phone that lets you keep track of all these digitally.

## Community and support

You can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/D9XTg2a7R8) server for any help or questions.
You can also open an issue on GitHub if you find any bugs or have feature requests.

## 💡 Why?

- Existing solutions do not have very good UI.
- Pretty graphs and summaries make everyone happy. Ryot aims to have a lot of them.
- There is a lack of a good self-hosted fitness and health tracking solution.
