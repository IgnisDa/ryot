Ryot (**R**oll **Y**our **O**wn **T**racker), pronounced "riot", aims to be the only self
hosted tracker you will ever need!

## üíª Demo

You can use the demo instance hosted on [Fly.io](https://ryot.fly.dev). Login and register
with the username `demo` and password `demo-password`. This instance is automatically
deployed from the latest release.

**NOTE**: The data in this instance can be deleted randomly.

## üìù ELI5

Imagine you have a special notebook where you can write down all the media you have
consumed, like books you've read, shows you have watched, video games you have played or
workouts you have done. Now, imagine that instead of a physical notebook, you have a
special tool on your computer or phone that lets you keep track of all these digitally.

## üí° Why?

- Existing solutions do not have very good UI.
- Pretty graphs and summaries make everyone happy. Ryot aims to have a lot of them.
- There is a lack of a good self-hosted fitness and health tracking solution.
- Ryot consumes very little memory (around 10MB idle eyeballing `docker stats`)

## üöÄ Features

  and fitness.

- ‚úÖ Documented GraphQL API
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand UI
- ‚úÖ Lightning fast (written in Rust BTW)

## üìñ Guides

Some things might not be obvious on how to setup or get working. I have written
a number of guides to make thing easier.

- [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment.md): Deploy Ryot to various platforms
- [Exporting](/docs/guides/exporting.md): Export your data from Ryot
- [Fitness](/docs/guides/fitness.md): Fitness tracking with Ryot
- [Importing](/docs/guides/importing.md): Import data from various sources
- [Integrations](/docs/guides/integrations.md): Integrations with various platforms
- [Video Games](/docs/guides/video-games.md): Get video games tracking working

## üîß Configuration options

You can specify configuration options via files (loaded from `config/ryot.json`,
`config/ryot.toml`, `config/ryot.yaml`) or via environment variables.

To set the equivalent environment variables, join keys by `_` (underscore) and
_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_ the characters.

Ryot serves the final configuration loaded at the `/config` endpoint as JSON
([example](https://ryot.fly.dev/config)). This can also be treated as a [health
endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring).

**Note**: You can see all possible configuration parameters in
the [generated schema](libs/generated/src/config/backend/schema.ts). The defaults
can be inspected in the [config](/apps/backend/src/config.rs) builder. Here are
some important ones:

## ü§ì Developer notes

In production, the frontend is a pre-rendered Nextjs app served statically by the Axum
backend server.

In development, both servers are started independently running on `:3000` and `:8000`
respectively. To get them running, install [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs), and
run `mprocs` in the project root. If you do not want to install `mprocs`, take a look at
[`mproc.yaml`](/mprocs.yaml) to see what all commands are needed to get it working.

Unless it is a very small change, I prefer creating a separate branch and merging it via an
MR when it is done. The changelog is generated using
[git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog). Once all changes are done, run the
following command to update the changelog.

```bash
$ git-chglog --next-tag <tag-name> -o CHANGELOG.md
```
