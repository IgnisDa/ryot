Ryot (**R**oll **Y**our **O**wn **T**racker), pronounced "riot", aims to be the only self
hosted tracker you will ever need!

## 💻 Demo

You can use the demo account on the Ryot website. Login with the username `demo` and
password `demo-password`. This instance is automatically deployed from the latest release.

**NOTE**: The data in this demo account is not recommended to be used for any production
usage. Please create a new account for that.

## 📝 ELI5

Imagine you have a special notebook where you can write down all the media you have
consumed, like books you've read, shows you have watched, video games you have played or
workouts you have done. Now, imagine that instead of a physical notebook, you have a
special tool on your computer or phone that lets you keep track of all these digitally.

## 💡 Why?

- Existing solutions do not have very good UI.
- Pretty graphs and summaries make everyone happy. Ryot aims to have a lot of them.
- There is a lack of a good self-hosted fitness and health tracking solution.
