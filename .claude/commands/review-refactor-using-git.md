# Review Refactor Using Git

Go through all the changed files using `git diff` and review the changes made in the
refactor. Make sure that there was ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE in functionality, only refactoring
of the code.

After the review is done, run `git diff --stat` to see the summary of changes made and
ensure that everything is in order. Then present it to the user in a pretty format along
with the lines of code changed and other relevant stats.

Make sure you think harder while going through the changes.
