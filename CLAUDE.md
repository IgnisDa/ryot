# Rules for Ryot

- The project uses `moon` for monorepo management. All frontend-related commands (like type
  checking, running tests, etc.) should use `moon` commands.
- You can read @apps/docs/src/contributing.md for an overview of the project architecture
  and some common commands.
- When making changes to the code, run the following commands generously to ensure that the
  changes you are making do not break anything:

  ```bash
  moon run frontend:typecheck # for frontend changes
  moon run docs:build # for docs changes
  moon run website:typecheck # for website changes
  cargo check --workspace # for backend changes
  ```

- When running tests, compile the backend in release mode and implement the feature first,
  then always ask the user's approval before executing tests to save iteration time.
- After adding a GraphQL query or mutation to the backend, run `moon run
  generated:backend-graphql` so that the frontend can use the new query or mutation.
- Do not add code comments unless strictly necessary.
- The migration files should be named `m<YYYYMMDD>_changes_for_issue_<number>`. Read other
  migration files for examples.
- We do not have down migrations since we always roll forward. It should just be an empty
  block with `Ok(())`.
- Since this is an open-source project, we have a slightly different approach to writing
  migrations. When adding a migration with a schema change, if the table you are working
  with already exists, then the same change should be applied to the migration where this
  table was first created. We need to do this so that new instances of Ryot can have the
  same table structure right off the bat.
- We try to keep the code files below 500 lines. If a file is larger than that, consider
  splitting it into smaller files (using functions, components, etc.) to improve
  readability.
