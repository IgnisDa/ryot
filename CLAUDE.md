# Rules for Ryot

- The project uses moon for mono repo management. So all commands (like typecheck, running tests etc) should use moon commands.
- After adding a graphql query/mutation to the backend, always run the command to regenerate graphql types. You can check the relevant moon.yml for the correct command.
