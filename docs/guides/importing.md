# Importing

Ryot supports importing media from a number of sources. Here are a few pointers.

To start importing, go to the settings page and select the "Import" tab.

## MediaTracker

The [MediaTracker](https://github.com/bonukai/MediaTracker) API is pretty
primitive and as a result the following things can not be imported.

- Items in progress
- Lists
- Calendar

### Steps

- Login to your MediaTracker account and click on your name on the top right.
- Click on the "Application tokens" section.
- Enter a name and click on "Add token".
- Copy the token that was just generated.
- Enter the details in the inputs.

## Goodreads

Shelves are not supported at the time of writing this.

### Steps

- Login to your Goodreads account and go to your profile.
- Find your account ID. The link in the browser will be in the format
  `https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/<user-id>-<username>`. You need to get the
  `user-id`. It will be a long number.
- Enter this number in the input.

## Notes

- Imports are very difficult to have 100% success rate. Though we try our best,
  you might have to manually import some data from your previous provider.
