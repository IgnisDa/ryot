# Deployment

The easiest way to deploy Ryot is using the [docker compose](./index.md#installation). Here
is a non-exhaustive set of guides to deploy Ryot to alternative platforms.

## Railway

1. Click on "+ New Project" on your dashboard and select "Empty project".
2. Once the project is created click on "+ New" and select "Database" and then
  "Add PostgreSQL".
3. Click on "+ New" again and select "Docker Image". Type `ghcr.io/ignisda/ryot`
  and hit Enter.
4. Click on the newly created service and go to the "Variables" section. Click on
  "New Variable" and then "Add Reference". Click on "Add".
5. Go to the "Settings" tab and then click on "Generate Domain".
6. Optionally, you can set the [healthcheck](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/healthchecks)
  path to `/backend/config`.

## Dokku

This is a script that automatically sets up a Ryot server using the docker image
uploaded to DockerHub and creates a [Dokku](https://dokku.com/) app. The script
assumes you have a global domain set-up (i.e. the file `/home/dokku/VHOST`
exists). It needs to be run with `sudo` privileges.

Re-running it updates the running server to the latest version.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  then echo "Please run as root"
  exit
fi

IMAGE_NAME="ghcr.io/ignisda/ryot"
APPNAME=""

read -rp "Enter the name of the app: " APPNAME

# check if app name is empty
if [ -z "$APPNAME" ]; then
    echo "App name empty. Using default name: ryot"
    APPNAME="ryot"
fi

# pull the latest image
docker rmi -f "$IMAGE_NAME" || true
docker pull "$IMAGE_NAME:latest"
image_sha="$(docker inspect --format={{ '"{{index .RepoDigests 0}}"' }} $IMAGE_NAME)"
echo "Calculated image sha: $image_sha"

if dokku apps:exists $APPNAME; then
    dokku git:from-image $APPNAME $image_sha || echo "Already on latest"
    exit 0
fi

dokku apps:create "$APPNAME"
dokku postgres:create "$APPNAME-service"
dokku postgres:link "$APPNAME-service" "$APPNAME"

# check if required dokku plugin exists
if ! dokku plugin:list | grep letsencrypt; then
    dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt.git
fi

dokku domains:add $APPNAME $APPNAME."$(cat /home/dokku/VHOST)"
dokku letsencrypt:enable "$APPNAME"
dokku git:from-image "$APPNAME" "$image_sha"
```

## Fly

The demo Ryot instance is deployed to [Fly](https://fly.io). The following steps
are required to deploy to Fly.

1. Create a new postgres database for Ryot.
   ```bash
   flyctl postgres create ryot-db
   ```

2. Copy the [`fly.toml`]({{ extra.file_path }}/config/fly.toml) file from this
   repository to your own repository. You **WILL** have to change the `app` key to
   a unique name. Deploy it using the below command.
   ```bash
   flyctl launch
   ```
3. Connect the database.
   ```bash
   fly postgres attach --app ryot ryot-db
   ```

4. Optionally you can configure the instance using `fly secrets set`.
   ```bash
   fly secrets set FILE_STORAGE_S3_URL='https://play.min.io:9000'
   ```

## Cosmos

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cosmos-Install%20Server-violet)](https://cosmos-cloud.io/proxy#cosmos-ui/market-listing/cosmos-cloud/Ryot)

You can install `ryot` from the Cosmos marketplace using this link: [Install
Ryot](https://cosmos-cloud.io/proxy#cosmos-ui/market-listing/cosmos-cloud/Ryot)
or by searching for `Ryot` in the marketplace.

Review the installation summary and click install to proceed. The database and
credentials will be automatically created for you, but make sure you are happy
with the URL chosen.

The instance will be available under your newly created URL via HTTPS if it
is enabled. You can then proceed with creating your first user via the web
interface's registration page.
