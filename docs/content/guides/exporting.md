# Exporting

You need to have S3 configured in order to export your data. You can find the necessary
configuration parameters under the
[`FileStorageConfig`](../configuration.md#all-parameters) section. The export will be made
in JSON format and always follow the schema (`CompleteExport`) described below.

You can export your data from the app by going to the "You data" page under settings and
then selecting the data you want to export under the "Export" tab.

Once the export is complete, it will appear along with a button to download it.

## One time file storage

If you want to use file storage only for exporting, you can configure it to use a public
S3 instance offered by [Minio](https://play.min.io).

!!! failure "Not for production use"

    The Minio team resets this instance every 24 hours, hence this method is not suitable
    if you want to store the data for a long time.

- Go to the [Minio playground](https://play.min.io).
- The username is `minioadmin` and password is `minioadmin`.
- Click on "Buckets" under the "Administrator" section and then on "Create Bucket".
- Set a name and click on "Create Bucket".
- Click on "Access Keys" under the "User" section and then on "Create access key".
- Leave everything as is and click on "Create". Copy both the values displayed.
- On your Ryot instance, set the following environment variables:
    ```sh
    FILE_STORAGE_S3_URL=https://play.min.io
    FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=ryot-demo
    FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=cqXhVseqa4mpqS4RLG3p
    FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=sJxF4eZkuc4Eo6daGEFhTctzKzGbY6G6qAQTb8Wy
    ```
- Restart your Ryot instance and follow the steps described in the previous section.
