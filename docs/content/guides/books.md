# Books

The default provider that Ryot uses for book tracking is
[Openlibrary](https://openlibrary.org). You might find it lacking in some cases, so Ryot
also supports other providers.

!!! warning

   Once you have followed any of the following steps, restart the server and delete the
   application cache using [this guide](../configuration.md#delete-all-cache).

## Hardcover

Ryot supports tracking books via [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app). I prefer this method
because the quality of data is much better than Openlibrary or Google Books. As of writing
this guide, the API key expires after a year, so you will need to renew it.

You can use the following steps to obtain your own API keys:

1. Create a [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app) account.
2. Go to the [API Access](https://hardcover.app/account/api) settings page and copy the
   header.
3. Set the environment variable as described in the [configuration](../configuration.md)
   docs.
   ```bash
   BOOKS_HARDCOVER_API_KEY=Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsCJ9.5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36Pw5c
   ```

## Google Books

Ryot also supports tracking books via [Google Books](https://books.google.com). You can
follow the below steps to obtain your own API keys and enable book tracking with Google
Books.

1. Create a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) account. Open your [Google
   Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Use the default project or click on "Create a project" on the dashboard.
3. Open the [APIs & Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
4. Click on "Enable APIs and Services". Search for "Google Books API" and click on
   "Enable".
5. Click on "Credentials" on the left sidebar. Click on "Create Credentials" and select
   "API key".
6.  Click on "Create" and copy the API key.
7. Set the `BOOKS_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` environment variable as described in the
   [configuration](../configuration.md) docs.
