!!! danger "Experimental"

    Fitness tracking with Ryot is experimental at best. I will do my best to not
    make incompatible breaking changes, and if I do, I will add a migration path
    in the release notes. If you use fitness features, please make sure you
    always read migration notes before upgrading to prevent loss of data.

Some pointers on Ryot and fitness tracking.
