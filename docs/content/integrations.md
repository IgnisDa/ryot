# Integrations

Integrations can be used to continuously update your media progress. They can
be of two types:

- _Yank_: Progress data is downloaded from an externally running server at a
periodic interval.
- _Sink_: An external client publishes progress updates to the Ryot server.

!!! info

    An item is marked as started when it has more than _2%_ progress and
    marked as completed when it has more than _95%_ progress.

## Yank plugins

For each integration you want to enable, credentials for the external server
must be saved to your profile. To do so, go to the "Settings" tab and add a
new integration under the "Integrations" tab.

### Audiobookshelf

The [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org) integration can sync all
media which have a match from _Audible_.

1. Obtain an API token as described in the Audiobookshelf
[authentication](https://api.audiobookshelf.org/#authentication) docs.
2. Go to your Ryot user settings and add the correct details as described in the
[yank](#yank-plugins) section.

## Sink plugins

To start, go to the "Settings" tab and generate a new application token from under
the "Tokens" tab. It will look like this: `e96fca00-18b1-467c-80f0-8534e09ed790`.

### Jellyfin

Automatically add new [Jellyin](https://jellyfin.org/) movie and show plays to
Movary. It will work for all the media that have been a valid TMDb ID attached
to their metadata.

    [unofficial webhook plugin](https://github.com/shemanaev/jellyfin-plugin-webhooks)
    to be installed and active in Jellyfin.

slug.
2. In the Jellyfin webhook plugin settings, add a new webhook using the
following settings:
