# IGDb

You can import your lists from [IGDb](https://www.igdb.com). Each list has to be imported
separately. A few points to note:

- Importing into the "In Progress" collection will set 5% progress for the items.
- Importing into the "Completed" collection will set 100% progress for the items.
- Import into any other collection will just add the items to the collection.

1. Login to your account and go to your profile. The default activity lists can be exported
  from  here. Click on the list you want to export and download it as CSV.
2. For your custom lists, please visit the "My Lists" page.
3. Upload the CSV file and choose the collection you want to import into.
