# MediaTracker

You can import from [MediaTracker](https://github.com/bonukai/MediaTracker), with
the following caveats:

- Items that are in progress are always imported with 100% progress. They are
  added to the "In Progress" collection so you can manually fix their progress
  if needed.

1. Login to your MediaTracker account and click on your name on the top right.
2. Click on the "Application tokens" section.
3. Enter a name and click on "Add token".
4. Copy the token that was just generated.
5. Enter the details in the inputs.
