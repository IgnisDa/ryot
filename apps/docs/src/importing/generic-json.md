# Generic Json

The "Generic Json" can be used to import all possible data from a generic JSON file. The
format of the JSON file should be `CompleteExport` as described in the
[exporting documentation](../exporting.md#type-definitions).

You can use this to export all your data from one Ryot instance and import it into another,
or from a source that is not supported by Ryot.
