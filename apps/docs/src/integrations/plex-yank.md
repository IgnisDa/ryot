# Plex Yank

This integration will add all media in your libraries to the "Owned" collection. If you
want to sync media progress, then take a look at the [Plex Sink](./plex-sink.md) integration.

1. Get the Plex token. If you want to import data for an admin account, then you need a
   [device
   token](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/#devicetoken).
   Otherwise, a current [user
   token](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/#getcurrentusertoken)
   is sufficient.
2. Go to your Ryot integration settings and fill in the details.
