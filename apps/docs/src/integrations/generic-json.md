# Generic Json

The "Generic Json" can be used to import all possible data using a generic JSON data
format. The format of the JSON file should be `CompleteExport` as described in the
[exporting](../guides/exporting.md#type-definitions) documentation.

Use this to integrate services that Ryot does not support natively.
