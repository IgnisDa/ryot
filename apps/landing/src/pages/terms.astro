        residency restrictions.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Accounts and Pro Key</h2>
      <p>
        Users can self-host the software and create accounts on their own
        infrastructure. A "Pro Key" is required to verify the purchase of the
        software. Users are responsible for securing their Pro Keys and ensuring
        their accounts are used in accordance with these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Subscription and Payments</h2>
      <p>
        The Service offers monthly and yearly subscription plans. Payments must
        be made on time to maintain access to the Pro features. Failure to pay
        on time may result in the revocation of your Pro Key and the
        deactivation of your server.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>

        Users must use the Service in a lawful and respectful manner. Any misuse
        of the Service, including but not limited to distributing illegal
        content, harassing other users, or attempting to breach the security of
        the Service, is prohibited.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Content Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        All content uploaded by users remains their property. By using the
        Service, users grant Ryot a limited, non-exclusive license to use,
        store, and display this content solely to provide the Service. Users
        must have the necessary rights to any content they upload.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data Privacy</h2>

        through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Indian
        Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>

        Ryot reserves the right to update these Terms at any time. Users will be
        notified of any changes via email or through the Service. Continued use
        of the Service after such changes will constitute acceptance of the new
        Terms.

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Ryot reserves the right to revoke your Pro Key and deactivate your

        If you cancel within the first 14 days of a monthly subscription, you
        are eligible for a full refund. For yearly subscriptions, cancellations
